# Data Sessions

Data Session is a peer learning community that provides free learning to beginning and intermediate data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers through online lessons, resource sharing, and collaborative projects. The community has grown to 60 people recently.

In this project, we will create a website for our community from the ground up, with the backend written entirely in Ruby on Rails. I'm both excited and nervous because I'm just getting started with Rails and this is my first project. I'll keep updating this as time goes on; for the time being, I'm still learning and building.

Watch some of the sessions we have held in the past on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uoqu81cfiPs)

Any support in building this is welcomed.
